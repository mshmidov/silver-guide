### (+) Best On The Saddle

While riding a horse, add its relevant Stat to your rolls, if it even remotely makes sense. In melee combat you inflict +1 harm. In beginning of each combat 
take +1 AD if all your enemies are slower than you.

Your horse is either stronger or more agile than average (+1 Steel or Edge to your rolls). If it suffer harm, roll Inflict Harm as for NPCs. If it dies, you 
will eventually be able to replace it with some cost.  

### Point Blank

When you fight with firearms in close quarters, you can Engage In Battle and roll +Steel instead of Edge.

### Handloader

You have a habit of collecting and reloading your used brass. For you, firearms ammo cost one Gear&ammo hold instead of two

###  Charge (xp)

When you ride your warhorse into a battle against a small gang or a large monster, you count as their peer as long as you are on the saddle and Roll+Steel now.

On a 10+ take both, on a 7-9 take one: 

* Ignore penalties for the size/number of the opponent
* Take penalties, but don’t roll Face Death in the fight

For each battle where you charge to helps friends or victims, or against monsters, take +1 Spirit.

### In the name of the Law (xp)

When you speak to someone or a crowd in the name of the frontier Law in appropriate context, roll +Charm. On a 10+ hold two, on a 7-9 hold one. 
If you’re Tainted, hold one more. Spend holds to:

* Obtain immunity for you and your companions
* Obtain immunity or forgiveness for someone else 
* Declare someone guilty
* Trigger the expression of a strong emotion from them: rage, fear, repentance, rebellion, peace, etc.
* They side with you as the voice of the frontier Law, so their leaders must pay attention to you
* Have them fight in your protection, or against who you say (but lose all remaining holds)

### Eye for the Truth (xp)

When you interact with people who accept your authority, you can roll +Edge.

On a 10+ hold two and take +1 Spirit. On a 7-9 hold one. If you’re Tainted, you can also roll +Steel instead of Edge to threaten them.

Spend your hold when you want, to ask a question:

* What is their strength? Or their best ally?
* What’s their weakness or secret? Or their weakest link?
* What is their greatest fear or worry?
* What or whom do they care about the most?
* How can I get in their graces or have their attention?
* Pay one hold so that your scrutiny remains secret.

On a 6- you still hold one, but the GM makes his move.

### No matter the cost (xp, Tainted only)

In a dire circumstance you can roll +Steel and name a purpose you want to reach no matter what. On a 10+ hold three. On a 7-9 hold two. On a 6- hold one. Spend 
holds to:
 
* Treat any single roll you need to make as 10+.
* Do not suffer harm from any single move.
* ? 
 
For each hold spent name a terrible cost you are willing to pay for your success. GM will make his moves to make it so.   


### Special Advancement 1
?

### True Grit (special, Tainted only)

When you take a deadly wound and die, become a walking dead focused on vengeance and judgement. With the help from GM name one unfinished business. You will not 
rest until it is done; do not stall, do not wait, do not focus yourself on anything else.
